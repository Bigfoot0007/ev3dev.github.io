Once you've written the ev3dev image to the SD card, booted, and setup a network 
connection, you may want to update to the latest kernel.  To do so:

1. Connect to the EV3 using SSH.  (Wireless or USB.)  The default login is 
username=robot, password=maker.

2. Execute these commands in sequence:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
    sudo reboot

3. Wait for each command to complete before typing the next.  Some steps require 
confirmation to proceed.  Press 'y' when asked.  The `upgrade` step may take up 
to a couple hours to complete.

4. After the brick has rebooted, press `About` on the brick's menu to confirm it
has a current kernel.
